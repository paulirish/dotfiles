# Executing external commands (1 - 10) invoked with key commands (F1 - F10 by
# default).
# Some arguments are substituted before executing:
# %f - file path
# %i - title made from tags
# %S - start block mark (in seconds)
# %E - end block mark (in seconds)
#
# Data from tags:
# %t - title
# %a - album
# %r - artist
# %n - track
# %m - time of the file (in seconds)
#
# Parameters above apply to the currently selected file. If you change them to
# capital letters, they are taken from the file currently playing.
#
# Programs are run using execv(), not a shell, so you can't do things like
# redirecting the output to a file. The command string is split using blank
# characters as separators, the first element is the command to be executed
# and the rest are parameters, so if you use "echo Playing: %I" we run program
# echo (from $PATH) with 2 parameters: 'Playing:' string and the title. Even
# if the title contains spaces it's still one parameter and it's safe if it
# contains `rm -rf /`.
#
# Examples:
ExecCommand5    = "mv %f ${GOOD_SONGS_DIR}"
ExecCommand6    = "rm %f"

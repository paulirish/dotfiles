# Paul's dotfiles

This repo is mostly for me but you're welcome to make suggestions. [mathias's readme](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/) is the project to fork.  I'm mostly catching up to him, @alrra, @paulmillr, @gf3.


My basic new machine setup is captured in `setup-a-new-machine.sh` which adds homebrew, z, nave, etc.

## private config

Toss it into a file called `.extra` which you do not commit to this repo and just keep in your `~/`

I do something nice with my `PATH` there:

```shell
# PATH like a bawss
      PATH=/opt/local/bin
PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/sbin
PATH=$PATH:/bin
PATH=$PATH:~/.rvm/bin
PATH=$PATH:~/code/git-friendly
# ...

export PATH
```

## Syntax highlighting

…is really important. even for these files.

Install [Dotfiles Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/mattbanks/dotfiles-syntax-highlighting-st2) via [Sublime Text 2 Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)


### Sensible OS X defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./.osx
```

Running sync copies from your dotfiles repo into `~/`. I'd prefer to do proper symlink but haven't gotten that far yet.
```bash
./sync.sh
```

To update later on, just run the sync again.
